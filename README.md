# Weather-Py
Weather Py

In this project I used the citypy and numpy libraries to create a random list of over 500 cities. I then made api calls to Open Weather Map
for each city. I pulled data from the json for each city and assigned each list as a column in a pandas data frame. I plotted the different aspects of the weather as it correlated to the lattitude of cities in several scatter plots using matplotlib. Then I wrote the data frame into a csv file.

tools used: git bash, jupyter notebook, https://openweathermap.org/api, python libraries: matplotlib, pandas, citypy, numpy, requests, time
